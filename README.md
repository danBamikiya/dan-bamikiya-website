  Dan Bamikiya's personal website
</h1>

Herein lies my personal website built with JavaScript, Gatsby (React + GraphQL), Sass, Heroku and some love.

Among many other things, it contains some side projects I'm proud of, links to where you can reach/connect with me & my skills.

_It undergoes fixes and improvements in the design, performance, accessibilty, compatibility, responsiveness & content whenever I have time to work on it/want to rebrand myself._
